# HACK :woman_technologist: :ribbon:

![HACK CI](https://github.com/angeldollface/hack/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

***Write strings with numbers instead of letters. :woman_technologist: :ribbon:***

## ABOUT :books:

Because I was thinking about what projects I could write, I decided to write a project that converts input strings into "hacker strings", strings that have numbers in them instead of letters, where possible. This repository contains the source code for a CLI application that does exactly this. Enjoy! :heart:

## INSTALLATION :hammer:

To install *Hack*, make sure that you have the following tools installed and available from the command line:

- A C++ compiler
- [Git](https://git-scm.org)
- CMake

Assuming you have these tools available, execute the following commands from a command prompt:

- 1.) Download this repository's source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/angeldollface/hack.git
```

- 2.) Change directory into the source directory's root:

```bash
cd hack
```

- 3.) Build the `hack` executable:

```bash
make build
```

- 4.) Move the generated executable to a location on your system's `$PATH`. You may have to change permissions.

## USAGE :hammer:

Assuming you installed ***Hack*** correctly, you can now use the `hack` command like this:

```bash
hack "Hello World!"
```

This will output the following string:

```text
H3ll0 W0rld!
```
